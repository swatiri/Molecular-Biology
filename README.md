# Molecular Biology
 This  is a field of science thats eeks to understand the chemical structures and processes of  macromolecules. The field of molecular biology is focused especially on nucleic acids (e.g., DNA and RNA) and proteinsâ€”macromolecules that are essential to life processes, and how these molecules interact and behave within cells. Molecular biology emerged in the 1930s, having developed out of the related fields of biochemistry, genetics, and biophysics; today it remains closely associated with those fields.
 ## DNA
 Deoxyribolnucleic acid  is a molecule that supplies the genetic instructions that instructs living creatures how to develop, live and reproduce. DNA can be found inside every cell and is passed down from parents to their offspring.
